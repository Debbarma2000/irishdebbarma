I am Irish Debbarma, a masters student at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. I am majoring in mathematics from the Mathematics Department. I am from the state of Tripura in the North-Eastern part of India. You can find my CV [here](/files/Irish_CV.pdf)

Besides math, I am also interested in reading about history, geopolitics and linguistics. 

I am a regular football player with loyalties to no club. I enjoy cycling and travelling as well.

## Research Interests
Although I am fairly interested in anything in number theory, the following topics interest me a lot and I would like to read more about them.
 - Modular forms, congruences between modular forms. 
 - Galois representations.
 - Automorphic representations.

## Projects (Past and Current)

 - For my Master's thesis, I am reading Gross-Stark conjecture. In particular the work of Dasgupta-Darmon-Pollack and Dasgupta-Kakde-Ventullo. This project is being supervised by [Prof. Mahesh Kakde](http://math.iisc.ac.in/~maheshkakde/) at IISc Bangalore. A draft thesis can be found [here](/files/Masters_Thesis_A.pdf)
 - My Bachelor thesis (submitted at the end of Spring 2023) was on Tate's thesis _Fourier Analysis in Number Fields and Hecke's Zeta Functions_ under the guidance of [Prof. Mahesh Kakde](http://math.iisc.ac.in/~maheshkakde/) at IISc Bangalore. Please find a my thesis [here](/files/tate_extended_thesis.pdf)
 - In the spring semester 2023, we read Linear Algebraic Groups from T.A. Springer's _Linear Algebraic Groups_ with an aim to understand reductive groups. This was done under the guidance of [Prof. Shaunak Deo](https://sites.google.com/view/shaunakdeo/).
 - I studied $p$-adic $L$-functions from  _Introduction to Cyclotomic Fields_ by Lawrence Washington (ongoing) independently.
 - I studied _The Uncertainty Principle_ in finite abelian groups with an aim to apply it to certain additive problems and extend it later to non abelian framework. I did this project under the guidance of Prof. Gautami Bhowmik of University of Lille, France. I was supported financially by [Charpak Lab scholarship](https://www.inde.campusfrance.org/charpak-lab-scholarship) and GARP funding by IISc, Bangalore. You can find my report [here](/files/UP_finale.pdf)
 - In the winter of 2021, I went through the proofs of <em> Cubic and Biquadratic reciprocity laws </em> from the book Introduction to Modern Number Theory by Ireland and Rosen under the guidance of [Prof. Shaunak Deo](https://sites.google.com/view/shaunakdeo/).
 - I read about <em> Zero-sum problems in Finite Abelian Groups </em> under the supervision of [Prof. Venkatesh Rajendran](https://sites.google.com/view/rvenkateshiisc/home?authuser=0) of maths Department, IISc . Work started from June mid and should continue till August mid formally but most likely continue for the whole year. I am trying to understand the structure of Finite Abelian Groups and find the value of related constants such as the Davenport's constant, Erd√∂s-Ginzberg-Ziv constant, Olson constant. The problem is still open and has very nice connections to other problems especially Non-unique factorisations in finite fields. Please find an incomplete report [here](/files/zero_sum_report.pdf)
 - In the summer of 2020, I did a reading project under [Prof. B. Sury](https://www.isibang.ac.in/~sury/) of [Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore](https://www.isibang.ac.in) . It was on the topic of <em> Binary Quadratic Forms </em>. I had solved Niven chapter 1-3 and then wrote a report on Binary Quadratic Forms, their reduction and also tried understanding Zagier's proof of Primes of the form 4k+1 as sum of two squares with the help of Binary Quadratic forms, and also read a bit about Gauss class problem.
