I am Irish Debbarma, a 3rd year Undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. I am majoring in mathematics from the Mathematics Department. I am from the state of Tripura in the North-Eastern part of India. 

I am also interested in reading about history, geopolitics and related topics. 

I am a regular football player with loyalties to no club. I enjoy cycling and travelling as well.

## Research Interests
Although I am fairly interested in anything in algebra, I am specifically interested in the followin topics
 - Analytic Number theory, modular forms and L-functions
 - Algebraic number theory, reciprocity laws
 - L-functions in p-adic settings, cyclotomic fields and Iwasawa theory
 - Combinatorial number theory

I am not saying that I know all of these topics, I am just very interested in learning all of the above.

## Projects (Past and Current)
 - 
 - I am currently reading about `Zero-sum problems in Finite Abelian Groups` under the supervision of [Prof. Venkatesh Rajendran](https://sites.google.com/view/rvenkateshiisc/home?authuser=0) of maths Department, IISc . Work started from June mid and should continue till August mid formally but most likely continue for the whole year. I am trying to understand the structure of Finite Abelian Groups and find the value of related constants such as the Davenport's constant, Erd√∂s-Ginzberg-Ziv constant, Olson constant. The problem is still open and has very nice connections to other problems especially Non-unique factorisations in finite fields. I shall write a report soon and maybe upload it here if possible.
 - In the summer of 2020, I did a reading project under [Prof. B. Sury](https://www.isibang.ac.in/~sury/) of [Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore](https://www.isibang.ac.in) . It was on the topic of `Binary Quadratic Forms`. I had solved Niven chapter 1-3 and then wrote a report on Binary Quadratic Forms, their reduction and also tried understanding Zagier's proof of `Primes of the form 4k+1 as sum of two squares` with the help of Binary Quadratic forms, and also read a bit about Gauss class problem. ([report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FuUQM5KR9zPizve3rVtkab-vVhHcP5rD/view?usp=sharing) )
- I also read Topology from M.A. Armstrong's book in summer,2020.
