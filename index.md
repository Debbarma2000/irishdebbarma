I am Irish Debbarma, a final year Undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. I am majoring in mathematics from the Mathematics Department. I am from the state of Tripura in the North-Eastern part of India. 

Besides math, I am also interested in reading about history, geopolitics and linguistics. 

I am a regular football player with loyalties to no club. I enjoy cycling and travelling as well.

## Research Interests
Although I am fairly interested in anything in number theory, the following topics interest me a lot and I would like to read more about them.
 - Modular forms and L-functions, automorphic forms. 
 - Algebraic number theory, reciprocity laws.
 - L-functions in p-adic settings, cyclotomic fields, Arithmetic Geometry.

I have made notes for my final semester which covers Algebraic Geometry, Modular forms, elliptic curves, commutative algebra, representation theory and algebraic number theory. Find it [here](https://github.com/Debbarma2000/final-semester/tree/main/notes)

## Projects (Past and Current)
 - My Bachelor thesis (to be submitted at the end of Spring 2023) is on Tate's thesis _Fourier Analysis in Number Fields and Hecke's Zeta Functions_ under the guidance of [Prof. Mahesh Kakde](http://math.iisc.ac.in/~maheshkakde/) at IISc Bangalore. Please find a draft of my thesis [here](/files/tate_extended_thesis.pdf)
 - I am reading about Linear Algebraic Groups from T.A. Springer's _Linear Algebraic Groups_ with an aim to read about reductive groups. This is being done under the guidance of [Prof. Shaunak Deo](https://sites.google.com/view/shaunakdeo/).
 - I studied $p$-adic $L$-functions from  _Introduction to Cyclotomic Fields_ by Lawrence Washington (ongoing) under the guidance of [Prof. Mahesh Kakde](http://math.iisc.ac.in/~maheshkakde/) of IISc Bangalore. 
 - I studied _The Uncertainty Principle_ in finite abelian groups with an aim to apply it to certain additive problems and extend it later to non abelian framework. I did this project under the guidance of Prof. Gautami Bhowmik of University of Lille, France. I was supported financially by [Charpak Lab scholarship](https://www.inde.campusfrance.org/charpak-lab-scholarship) and GARP funding by IISc, Bangalore. You can find my report [here](/files/UP_finale.pdf)
 - I have read Introduction to Analytic Number Theory- Tom Apostol by myself. I have recently come across Selberg Sieves and intend to read more about it.
 - In the winter of 2021, I went through the proofs of <em> Cubic and Biquadratic reciprocity laws </em> from the book Introduction to Modern Number Theory by Ireland and Rosen under the guidance of [Prof. Shaunak Deo](https://sites.google.com/view/shaunakdeo/).
 - I read about <em> Zero-sum problems in Finite Abelian Groups </em> under the supervision of [Prof. Venkatesh Rajendran](https://sites.google.com/view/rvenkateshiisc/home?authuser=0) of maths Department, IISc . Work started from June mid and should continue till August mid formally but most likely continue for the whole year. I am trying to understand the structure of Finite Abelian Groups and find the value of related constants such as the Davenport's constant, Erd√∂s-Ginzberg-Ziv constant, Olson constant. The problem is still open and has very nice connections to other problems especially Non-unique factorisations in finite fields. Please find an incomplete report [here](/files/zero_sum_report.pdf)
 - In the summer of 2020, I did a reading project under [Prof. B. Sury](https://www.isibang.ac.in/~sury/) of [Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore](https://www.isibang.ac.in) . It was on the topic of <em> Binary Quadratic Forms </em>. I had solved Niven chapter 1-3 and then wrote a report on Binary Quadratic Forms, their reduction and also tried understanding Zagier's proof of Primes of the form 4k+1 as sum of two squares with the help of Binary Quadratic forms, and also read a bit about Gauss class problem.
