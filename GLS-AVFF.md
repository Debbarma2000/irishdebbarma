This webpage was created when we were studying Abelian Varieties over finite fields at Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru under the supervision of Professor Shaunak Deo. 

These reading seminars were a continuation to our participation in Preliminary AWS 2023. 

We use this as a repository for future reference. We outline the lectures (content covered) and the resources used for preparing those lectures. If possible we also provide lecture notes.
