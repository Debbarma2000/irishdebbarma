If you wondered how do people typeset those beautiful math papers and books, the answer is LaTeX. An essential tool (not necessary) which will come in handy a lot. You can learn it from [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1D4EAB31D3EBC449) and of course google. (Thumb rule: if you want a certain command most likely it is \command, eg: \since, \therefore)
Another essential tool that comes in handy for mathematicians is sagemath which you can learn [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fnptel.ac.in%2Fcourses%2F111%2F106%2F111106149%2F&sa=D).

## **Recommendations**

### **Maths**

1. Real Analysis  
    -  Tom Apostol. _Calculus_ Volume - I, II 
    - Ghorpade, Limaye. _A course in Calculus and Real Analysis_ 
    - Ghorpade, Limaye. _A course in Multivariable Calclulus and Analysis_
    - Walter Rudin. _Principle of Mathematical Analysis_
    - Abbott. _Understanding Analysis_
    - Rami Shakarchi. _Problems and Solutions for Undergraduate Analysis_
    - Terence Tao. _Analysis I, II_  
    <span style="color: brown"> 
     Apostol volumes and/or Ghorpade, Limaye volumes can be used as beginner text. Rudin's book is a classic but might not be very suitable for people who are seeing analysis for the first time.</span>
   
2. Abstract Algebra
    - Joseph Gallian. _Contemporary Abstract Algebra_
    - Dummit and Foote. _Abstract Algebra_  
    - Serge Lang. _Undergraduate Algebra_
    - Serge Lang. _Algebra_
    <span style="color: brown"> 
    Gallian would be a nice place to start your journey. Once you are done you can move to Dummit Foote (it covers almost everything) and after that if you continue you will be using books that are dedicated to certain topics anyway. Lang's Undergraduate Algebra can also be a nice first time source. 
    </span>  
3. Combinatorics
    - Aigner. _A course in enumeration_
    - Andreescu, Feng. _A Path to Combinatorics for Undergrduates_
    - R.P. Stanley. _Enumerative Combinatorics_  
    <span style="color: brown"> 
     Aigner's book is a very nice one and can be used independent of others. Otherwise all three of them are very nice.</span>
4. Number Theory
    - D.M. Burton. _Elementary Number Theory_
    - Niven, Montgomery. _Introduction to Theory of Numbers_  
    <span style="color: brown"> 
    Burton's book is a classic and should be **the** book for beginners. Once you are comfortable with the stuff in Burton you can move to Niven. </span>
5. Topology

     All three books are excellent. Use whatever you like.</span>
